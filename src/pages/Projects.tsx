After logging in, users must complete multi-factor authentication by entering an OTP sent to their mobile. Once logged in, the dashboard displays only specific sections, while others remain locked for added security. Users can unlock these private sections by entering a 4- or 6-digit PIN. To ensure safety, sessions automatically log out after 1 minute of inactivity, and unlocked sections require the PIN again if accessed in a new session, maintaining tight control over sensitive information.',

This research proposes a new NFT marketplace design that automatically manages digital asset inheritance using blockchain technology and smart contracts. The system detects long-term user inactivity and securely redistributes assets through four options: donating to charity, selling assets and giving the money to family, transferring NFTs directly to heirs, or transferring them to a legal representative. Tests on the Ethereum network showed very high accuracy and reliability. Overall, the solution ensures NFTs are not lost, supports legal and transparent inheritance, and can be easily integrated into existing Web3 platforms for long-term digital asset management.',
